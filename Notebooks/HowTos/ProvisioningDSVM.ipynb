However, sometimes you do want to have a powerful computing environment, and you don't want to go through Direct Compute route which requires JupyterHub installation on Linux machines, then Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) becomes a vital choice.\n\nYou may reference <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/notebooks/configure-manage-azure-notebooks-projects' target='_blank'>this article</a> for details.  In a nutshell, you need to select Linux VM with Ubuntu flavor.  And keep in mind that on Azure DSVM, if you want to use Python 3.6 which is required by Azure Sentinel notebooks, you need to <font color=red> select Python 3.6 - AzureML.</font>"

First, please read <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/dsvm-ubuntu-intro' target='_blank'>this article</a> for details\n1. Go to Azure portal\n2. Search for Data Science Virtual Machine under All Services<br>\n![select](images/select.png)<br>\n3. Select DSVM for Linux (Ubuntu), read the introduction, click Create button.  On the following page shown below, following the instruction to complete the form.  You need to use the same Azure subscription that you are using for your Azure Sentinel and Azure Log Analytics.  And make sure you select Password and check 'Login with Azure Active Directory'.<br>\n![create](images/create.png)<br>\n4. Once a DSVM created, make sure you keep SSH public key and password in a safe place.\n5. If you want to remote into the VM using SSH, you can add inbound port rule for port 22."

Now that you have a DSVM, when you login to https://notebooks.azure.com, you can see you DSVM on the drop down list under Free Compute and Direct Compute.<br>\n![dropdown](images/dropdown.png)<br>\n2. Of course you will select DSVM, it will ask you to validate your JIT credentials.<br>\n![login](images/login.png)<br>\n3.

      "source": "## 3. Things to know about using DSVM\n\n1. The most important thing to know about Azure Notebooks on DSVM is that: Azure Notebooks project home directory is not mounted on the DSVM.  So any references to Azure Notebooks  folders / files will incur File/folder not found exception.  In other words, each ipynb notebook need to be independent of other files.  \n2. There are work-around solutions:<br>\n    a. Data files can be stored on Azure Blob storage and <a href='https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-fuse' target='_blank'>blobfufe</a><br>\n    b. Python files can be added to the notebook by using the Jupyter magic, you can find an example here: <a href='https://github.com/Microsoft/connect-petdetector/blob/master/setup.ipynb' target='_blank'>%%writefile</a><br>\n    c. Configuration files are a bit more complicated.  Using our Azure Sentinel config.json as an example, it is generated when you import Azure Sentinel Jupyter project from GitHub repo through Azure portal.  The configuration JSON is Azure Log Analytics workspace specific file, so you clone one project for one Log Analytics workspace.  You can find the config.json file at the root of the project home directory.  <a href='https://orion-zhaozp.notebooks.azure.com/j/notebooks/Notebooks/Get%20Start.ipynb' target='_blank'>Get Start.jpynb</a>  section 1 demonstrates how to set the configuration settings manually.
