# Samples

This is a collection of sample notebooks (usually with output and widget state preserved) that give you more of a sense of what the notebook will do.

This folder also contains example notebooks that demonstrate technique using specific cases as examples. As such they would not produce meaningful results in other environments. The intention is that you can use these notebooks as resources to copy and paste into your own notebooks.

## Viewing the notebooks
You can view any of the notebooks directly on github just by clicking on them.

For higher fidelity rendering we'd recommend Jupyter nbviewer.
- Open a notebook here and copy the URL
- Go to <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/">Jupyter nbview</a> and paste the URL into the location text box.
- Hit the Go! button
