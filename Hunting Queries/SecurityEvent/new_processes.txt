// Name: New processes observed in last 24 hours
//
// Id: 513e3a11-e1bb-4cfc-8af9-451da0407e6b
//
// Description: These new processes could be benign new programs installed on hosts; however, especially in normally stable environments, 
//   these new processes could provide an indication of an unauthorized/malicious binary that has been installed and run. 
//   Reviewing the wider context of the logon sessions in which these binaries ran can provide a good starting point for identifying possible attacks.
