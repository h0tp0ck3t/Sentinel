// Name: Azure storage key enumeration

// Id: 5d2399f9-ea5c-4e67-9435-1fba745f3a39
//
// Description: Listing of storage keys is an interesting operation in Azure which might expose additional 
// secrets and PII to callers as well as granting access to VMs. While there are many benign operations of this
// type, it would be interesting to see if the account performing this activity or the source IP address from 
// which it is being done is anomalous. 
// The query below generates known clusters of ip address per caller, notice that users which only had single
// operations do not appear in this list as we cannot learn from it their normal activity (only based on a single
// event). The activities for listing storage account keys is correlated with this learned 
// clusters of expected activities and activity which is not expected is returned.
