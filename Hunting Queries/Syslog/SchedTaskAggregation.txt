// Name: Scheduled Task Aggregation
// Description: This query aggregates information about all of the scheduled tasks (cron jobs) and presents the data in a chart
//              The aggregation is done based on unique user-commandline pairs. It returns how many times a command line has
//              been run from a particular user, how many computers that pair has run on, and what percentage that is of the
//              total number of computers in the tenant.
