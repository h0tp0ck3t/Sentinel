// Name: DNS high NXDomain count
// Id: a0907abe-6925-4d90-af2b-c7e89dc201a6
//
// Description: clients with a high NXDomain count could be indicative of a DGA (cycling through possible C2 domains
// where most C2s are not live). Alert is generated when a new IP is seen (based on not being seen associated with 
// NXDomain records in prior 10-day baseline period)
//
// DataSource: #DnsEvents
//
// Severity: Medium
//
// QueryFrequency: 24
//
// QueryPeriod: 24
//
// AlertTriggerOperator: gt
//
// AlertTriggerThreshold: 0
//
// Tactics: #C2, #Exfiltration
//
// NXDomain events, with some likely uninteresting records filtered out
