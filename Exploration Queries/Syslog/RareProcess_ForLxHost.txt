// Name: Linux - Process Rare for Host
// Description: Lookup your interesting process and see on what hosts it is rare.  
// Less than 1% of the average and less than a count of 100 on a given host or less than a 14 count on a given host over 7 days
//
// Entity: Process
// Input: ProcessName
// Output: Hosts
//
// QueryPeriod: -7d, change as needed
//
// Data Source: Syslog
//
// Tactics: #Execution, #Persistence, #Discovery, #Lateral Movement, #Collection
//
